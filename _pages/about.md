I am a Ph.D. Student and NSF Graduate Student Research Fellow at Yale University's School of the Environment. I am interested in environmental and natural resource economics, industrial organization, trade, and public finance.

Prior to my Ph.D., I worked at the University of Mannheim, Stanford University, and the University of California Berkeley. 

While thinking about research ideas, I enjoy ice hockey, biking, hiking, chess, and generally breathing fresh air.
