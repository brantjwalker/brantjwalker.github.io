title: "Are Earmarks Equally Targeted: Evidence from US Drinking Water"
collection: publications
category: manuscripts
permalink: /publication/Earmarks2024
excerpt: 'We study federal spending in the US on drinking water investments. Congressional Earmarks, traditionally known as "pork barrel" spending, disproportionately benefit Hispanic but not Black or low-income communities compared to loans. All funding sources target Black, Hispanic, and low-income communities mainly due to targeting population dense areas.'
