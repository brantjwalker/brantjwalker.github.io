collection: publications
category: manuscripts
permalink: /publication/clear2025
excerpt: 'We develop an ex ante deep learning framework to project the effects of proposed policy reforms. Our model outperforms traditional methods of policy projects done by domain experts and allows flexibility to optimize on your preferred performance metric. Using the CLEAR model, a new model developed to map jurisdiction under the Clean Water Act, we document changes in jurisdictional patterns due to the recent *Sackett* Supreme Court decision. Sackett removes protections for about a third of streams, wetlands, and floodplains. '
